                <p>My name is Konrad, and for over two years, I have been delving into the intricacies of web
                    technologies. I have dedicated the majority of my time and knowledge to frontend development. I am
                    proficient in HTML, CSS (including frameworks like Bootstrap and styling tools such as Material-UI).
                    For dynamic DOM manipulation, I am adept at using vanilla JavaScript as well as jQuery. Recently, my
                    focus has been on mastering React. I am also familiar with PHP syntax and capable of building simple
                    applications utilizing this language for both backend and frontend development. I have a solid
                    foundation in SQL queries and can work with various databases, including Firebase. In the near
                    future, I plan to explore Node.js and deepen my knowledge of React (with potential interest in React
                    Native as well). I am highly
                    ambitious, eager to learn, and deeply passionate about my craft. My current aspiration is to join a
                    collaborative project team where I can apply my knowledge in a commercial setting.</p>
